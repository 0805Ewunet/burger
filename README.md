# burger
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page, waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. This app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
 
Simply put, # burger is an app that lets the user eat their way through their favorite and most imaginative burgers.
